    This here shows that we can use the surrounding forward slash-asterisk combos (forward slash-asterisk ... asterisk forward-slash).  
    It's a multi-line comment, and originated in the C language, so sometimes it's called a C style comment.

    Use comments, multi-line or single line, to describe what the code is doing; it works well with psuedocode - describing in lay terms what the code will do.
        Block out code we want to save for later, or when trying to troubleshoot.
